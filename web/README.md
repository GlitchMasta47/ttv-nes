# ttv-nes website

This is the website for the ttv-nes project, occasionally [streamed on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/glitchmasta47). The website is made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.io/).

## Running Locally

Ensure you have a generally recent version of [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/) installed on your system. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) or [download](https://github.com/GlitchMasta47/ttv-nes/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the repo, then make your changes in the project folder.

To start a development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Once it starts, you can open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the site.

You can start editing the page by modifying any of the files in `pages/`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Next.js Help

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

## Making Changes

Commits to the `main` branch are deployed to [the public website](https://ttv-nes.gm47.cf) in less than 2 minutes, assuming your code has no errors and the build process was successful. When adding new features or fixing bugs, create a new branch with a fitting/relevant name and test locally. When you're done with the changes, PR to the `main` branch when you have confirmed that no new bugs have been introduced and the build runs without errors or failures.
